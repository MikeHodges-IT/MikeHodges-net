    <h3>Explanation of Calculations:</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Initial Costs:</strong> Renters typically pay the first month’s rent plus a security deposit equal to one month’s rent, totaling $3,600 for an initial outlay. In contrast, the initial cost of purchasing a home through a CLT includes a down payment, which we assume here at 3% of the purchase price, totaling $5,625. This higher upfront cost for the CLT provides stability and long-term savings.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Monthly Costs:</strong> For renting, we assume an initial monthly payment of $1,800 with an annual 3% increase, leading to increased payments each year. This 3% annual increase in rent is based on average rent trends in Central Florida, causing the rent to grow significantly over time. The CLT mortgage, however, remains fixed at $1,226.42 (mortgage payment + $50 ground lease fee) over the 30-year period.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Total Costs Over Time:</strong> After 10 years, renting becomes significantly more expensive than the CLT mortgage, with renters paying around $2,052 per month due to annual increases, compared to the stable CLT payment of $1,226.42. By 20 and 30 years, the rent continues to grow, reaching $2,816.60 per month by year 30.
