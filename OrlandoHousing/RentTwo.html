    <h3>Explanation of Calculations:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Initial Costs:</strong> Renters typically pay the first month’s rent plus a security deposit equal to one month’s rent, totaling $3,600 for an initial outlay. For a CLT home, the initial cost includes a down payment at 3% of the purchase price, totaling $5,625. Though higher, this upfront CLT cost provides long-term stability.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Monthly Costs and Interest Impact:</strong> For renting, an initial monthly payment of $1,800 increases annually by 3%. In contrast, the CLT mortgage provides a fixed monthly payment depending on the interest rate, with only a ground lease fee ($50). As interest rates increase (from 4% to 7%), both the monthly payments and total costs rise. A fixed mortgage payment avoids the rental price inflation typical in the Central Florida area.
